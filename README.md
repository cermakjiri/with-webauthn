## Development

### Common Stack notes:

-   The whole project is managed using tuborepo.
-   All examples are in NextJS (React) framework.
-   API calls are handled with React Tanstack query on client.
-   API endpoints are built via NextJS API routes.
-   Forms are built with react-hook-form and validated with zod schemas.
-   Material UI with styled components as UI SDK.

### How to start the project locally?

1. Initialize package manager:
   Make sure you're running Node v20. Then initialize a package manager:

    ```sh
    corepack enable
    corepack install
    ```

    It finds `packageManager` field and installs Yarn 4.

2. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    yarn install --immutable
    ```

3. Note that common code of each example is placed in `packages/common` (for client and server).

4. Then continue with final steps for specific example:
    - [Authenticate with passkeys](examples/webauthn-default/README.md)
    - [Upgrade to passkeys](examples/webauthn-upgrade/README.md)
